I need people to help me split up and rename images.


Here are some things when splitting Character(NPC) images:
- Images must be 25 px tall
- Images must have the sub images 16 px wide 
      (so if a Character image has 7 different drawings in it, it needs to be a total of 112 px wide. Each drawing having a 16 px width)

Do not split the Object images yet. I still have to figure out how to load them.

Some notes:
- Character images are taller than tile images
- Objects/Tile images are 16 X 16 px
